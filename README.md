# Sorting Hat
Create a form where user can be required to enter name and be sorted into a house! You can then sort students by House and Name or Expel them to Volemort's army!

Upon load user will see a sorting hat button. Upon pressing the button, user will see hidden form displayed with a name input and a sort button. Upon pressing the sort button, user will see a card generated with entered name and generated house name. If name input is left blank, instead of a card, user will see an error message with instructions on how to close.
